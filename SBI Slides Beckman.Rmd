## Brief Course Description  
- STAT 250: Introduction to Biostatistics  
- 225 students enroll each semester  
- Lecture Mon & Fri (50 min; all students)  
- Lab Wed (50 min; 3 sections x 75 students)  
- Design  
    - Question of the day (life science; sometimes PSU rsh)  
    - StatKey + Minitab  
    - In-class exams  


## Pedagogical opportunities: SBI  
- Mathematical exposure
    - Fewer appeals to unseen mathematics (i.e. "hand waiving")
    - Natural scaffolding
        - Tangible/tactile introduction (Ernst 2004; Rossman, 2008)  
        - Permutation distribution as possible segue (Ernst, 2004)
        - Transfer tedious yet simple process to computer (Cobb, 2007)
    - Intuition built on frequencies (Gigerenzer & Hoffrage, 1995)  
- Flexibility of application (Efron, 2000, p. 1294)  
- Facilitates some useful conversations  
    - Thinking under the null (Wild et al. 2011)
    - p-values and the nature of randomness (Rossman, 2008)
    - Why OK to sample with replacement? 

## Pedagogical opportunities: SBI  
- Introduce key concepts using SBI; revisit with non-SBI  
    - Lock et al. (2013)
    - Tintle et al. (2016)
    - Zieffler et al. (2015); Garfield et al. (2012)
- SBI students seem to perform as well or better than peers in non-SBI courses
    - Maurer & Lock (2016)
    - Beckman, delMas, & Garfield (in press)
    - Tintle et al. (2012)

## Pedagogical opportunities: Large enrollment  
- Large sample size for student generated data (GAISE, 2016)
    - reliable demonstrations of asymptotic properties (e.g. CLT) using data generated in-class
    - unusual observations often generated in-class
        - outliers (e.g. wrong units & typos)
        - legitimate extreme obs. (the tails are real)
        - sensitivity analysis discussions
- (Anonymous) Engagement  
    - Crowd-sourced Q&A  
    - Live SMS inbox  
    - Clickers 
        - instant feedback  
        - instant run-off  


## Pedagogical opportunities: Intersection of SBI & large enrollment   
- Example: m&m activity in lecture  
    - Live capture in Google Sheet
    - class approximates a sampling distribution  
    - student builds bootstrap distribution  
    - tangible comparison of sampling dist & bootstrap dist  
- Example: StatKey on smart phones (during lecture)  
    - accessible & scalable technology integration  
    - partner work (one run the app; one take notes)
