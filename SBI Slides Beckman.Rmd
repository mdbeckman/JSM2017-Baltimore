## Outline: 

- (MB) Brief Course Description
- (MB) Pedagogical considerations
    - SBI
    - large enrollment
    - intersection of SBI & large enrollment
- (KLM) Compare/Contrast with other approaches (i.e. informal discussant)


## Brief Course Description  

- 200-225 students enrolled each semester
- Lecture Mon & Fri with all students (50 min)
- Lab sections Wed with 70-80 students each (50 min)
- Question of the day (usually life science, sometimes PSU research)
- Final Project

## Pedagogical considerations

- SBI
    - building intution
    - tangible machinery
    - revisit key concepts through both SBI & non-SBI
- large enrollment
    - crowd-sourced Q&A
    - Google sheets in lecture
    - text message inbox
    - clickers
- intersection of SBI & large enrollment
    - M&M simulation 
    - StatKey during lecture

## Compare/Contrast with other approaches (i.e. informal discussant)
