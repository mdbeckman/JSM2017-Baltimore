## Brief Course Description  
- STAT 250: Introduction to Biostatistics  
- 225 students enroll each semester  
- Lecture Mon & Fri (50 min; all students)  
- Lab Wed (50 min; 3 sections x 75 students)  
- Design  
    - Question of the day (life science; sometimes PSU rsh)  
    - StatKey + Minitab  
    - In-class exams  


## Pedagogical opportunities: SBI  
- Tangible machinery (Ernst 2004; Rossman, 2008)  
- Intution built on frequencies (Gigerenzer & Hoffrage, 1995)  
- Permutation distr. segue (Ernst, 2004) 
- Introduce key concepts with SBI; revisit with non-SBI  
    - Lock et al. (2017)
    - Tintle et al. (2016)
    - Zieffler et al. (2012)


## Pedagogical opportunities: Large enrollment  
- Large sample size for student generated data (GAISE, 2016)
    - reliable demonstrations of asymptotic properties (e.g. CLT) using data generated in-class
    - even anomalies are useful (e.g. outliers from wrong units & typos vs. legitimate extreme obs.)
- (Anonymous) Engagement  
    - Crowd-sourced Q&A  
    - Live SMS inbox  
    - Clickers 
        - instant feedback  
        - instant run-off  


## Pedagogical opportunities: Intersection of SBI & large enrollment   
- Example: m&m activity in lecture  
    - Live capture in Google Sheet
    - class builds sampling distribution  
    - student builds bootstrap distribution  
    - tangible comparison of sampling dist & bootstrap dist  
- Example: StatKey on smart phones (during lecture)  
    - accessible & scalable technology integration  
    - partner work (one run the app; one take notes)
